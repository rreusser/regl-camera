# @rreusser/regl-camera
A basic reusable "turntable" camera component for [regl](http://regl.party).  (Secretly just [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system).)


## THIS FORK

**@rreusser/regl-camera is deprecated since fixes have been merged upstream into [regl-camera](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regl-camera). Unless you require a couple undocumented things like the inverse view matrix that this module casually injects, please use that instead!**

**Note**
These properties can also be accessed and modified directly by accessing the object
